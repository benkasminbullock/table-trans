=head1 NAME

Table::Trans - simple translations for templating

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Table::Trans;

=head1 VERSION

This documents version 0.00_01 of Table-Trans
corresponding to L<git commit 9b9b0b6002304d6c1e40118afd900c2be5faa9f6|https://github.com/benkasminbullock/table-trans/commit/9b9b0b6002304d6c1e40118afd900c2be5faa9f6> released on Thu Jan 28 23:49:21 2021 +0900.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Very simple translation storage. I made this because TMX was such a
pain to use.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 get_lang_name

    my $language = get_lang_name ($lang);

Given a language code like C<en>, convert it into the native name of
the language, like "English".

=head2 get_lang_trans

     get_lang_trans ($trans, $vars, $lang);

Put the translations from $trans for language $lang into
$vars->{trans}.

=head2 read_trans

    my $trans = read_trans ('file.txt');

Also get the order:

    my ($trans, $order) = read_trans ('file.txt');

Read a file of translations in L<Table::Readable> format.

=head2 trans_to_json_file

    trans_to_json_file ('file.txt', 'file.json');

Convert the translations in F<file.txt> into F<file.json>.

=head2 write_trans

     write_trans (\%trans, [qw/en ja es/], "output.txt", \@id_order);

Write the translations stored in C<%trans> for the languages "en",
"ja" and "es" in the order given by C<@id_order> to the file
C<output.txt> in the L<Table::Readable> format.

=head1 FORMAT

The basic format of the translations is in L<Table::Readable> format
with each translated piece of text being identified with the code
C<id> then each particular language having its own entry.

=head2 Macros

Macros to insert another translation can be used in the form C<{{id}}>
and the translation of C<id> in the language of the entry will be
inserted, so if we have

    id: ape
    en: monkey
    ja: さる

    id: monkeyshines
    en: {{ape}}shines
    ja: {{ape}}さわぎ

then the C<ja> entry for the ID "monkeyshines" will be さるさわぎ and
the English entry will be "monkeyshines". There is currently no
cross-language way of getting macros or non-language way of inserting
them.
